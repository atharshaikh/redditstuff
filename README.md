# redditstuff
a collection of reddit scripts i've made and use

1)/replybot contains a really basic auto-reply bot for reddit. there's more instructions inside that

2)modq.py gets a list of subreddit-wise modqueue items, in the descending order and the total.

3)finalmodlog.py is a script that you can use to get the modlogs and save onto a local postgresql server, making it easier for you to get the matrix.
